# Tile Map Editor For Unity
Very basic tile map editor. 

How to:

1. The script loads your tile prefabs from Assets/Resources/Prefabs. Make sure you put your prefabs in there.
2. Window > Map Editor.
3. Select a tile you want to spawn in the scene.
4. Spawn the tile in the scene view by pressing 'E'.
5. Use "WSAD" keys to 'snap spawn' the tiles around the currently selected tile.
6. The currently selected tile is indicated by an 'X' mark above it.
7. Click on any already tile in the scene view to set it as your currently selected tile.
8. Use 'X' to undo.
